A utility for finding the best Gifs using gyphy

Shane Chambry

This assignment was our first forray into using AJAX and API calls! The object is to use Gyphy to retrieve some gifs according to a search term. For mine, I was careful to utilize the random endpoint in stead of the search endpoint to get a better spread of the returned gifs. I also added a dynamically generated loading animation which took the polish to a new level. This site is also one of my first that is fully mobile responsive. I really enjoyed this assignment.
