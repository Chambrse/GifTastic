```

This app uses AJAX and the giphy api; put together in a way to allow returning a random selection of gifs relating to an input search term. The app uses local storage to store favorited gifs, and also uses a dynamic loading animation to give the user some feedback. It is also fully responsive and works on tablet and phone screens.

Upon loading the page, simply click one of the pre-loaded buttons or type in a search term to get some gifs. Once loaded, click a desired gif to play it. Click again to stop the gif.

To add a gif to your favorites, click the star in the lower-right hand corner. Clicking the star again will remove it from the list. 

To view your favorites, click on the favorites button at the top of the screen.
